# Summary 
 
```{admonition} Random Experiment
A process leading to an uncertain outcome.
```

```{admonition} State Space
The state space is the collection of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, usually denoted by $S$.
```

```{admonition} Basic Outcome
A possible outcome of a random experiment.
```

```{admonition} Event
An event is a subset of basic outcomes. Any event which consists of a single outcome in the state space is called a simple event.
```

```{admonition} Probability
A probability is a measure for how likely an outcome of a random experiment is. For an event $A$, this is usually denoted by $P(A)$.
```

```{admonition} Laws of Probabilities
- **Law 1.**  For every state space $S$, $P(S) = 1$.
- **Law 2.**  For any event $A$, $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$.
- **Law 3.**  For disjoint events $A$ and $B$, $P( A \cup B) = P (A) + P(B)$.
```

```{admonition} Independence
Two events $A$ and $B$ are (statistically) independent if and only if the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occuring is the product of the probabilities of the two events $P(A \cap B) = P(A \,\text{and}\, B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$.
```

```{hint}
1. Make sure that your sample space includes all of the possibilities.
2. Check that the probabilities assigned to all of the possible outcomes add up to 1.
```

```{caution}
1. Do not multiply probabilities of dependent events.
2. Avoid assigning the same probability to every outcome (unless, of course, you are convinced that all outcomes are equally likely).
3. Do not confuse independent events with disjoint events.
```

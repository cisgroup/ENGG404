# Welcome

The goal of this course is to provide the students with a thorough understanding of the key concepts behind structural reliability and risk analysis. After this course the students will have refreshed their knowledge of probability theory and statistics to model uncertainties in view of engineering applications. They will be able to apply computational methods for evaluating probabilities of failure, and more generally probabilities of rare events related to any system performance. They will know risk assessment methods for decision making under uncertain conditions. They will be aware of the state-of-the-art computational methods and software in this field.

The course combines a series of **theory lectures** -- which introduce theoretical foundations of probability theory, uncertainty quantification and risk assessment -- with **practice lectures** that show how to apply those methods to real-world problems. The course material consists of annotated slides for theory lectures, video lectures, and notebooks for practice lectures. Students can apply and deepen their knowledge through exercise sheets. The successful completion of the course requires to pass a final open-book exam.
